<h2>How the WEB works</h2>
<p>
Web is a mesh of computers that communicate each other.<br>
Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet must have a unique address. 
Internet addresses are in the form nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255. This address is known as an IP address. 
(IP stands for Internet Protocol)<br>
